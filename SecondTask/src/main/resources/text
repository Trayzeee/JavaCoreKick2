    The morning was quiet and cold. Sarah opened the window and looked at the empty
street. A thin fog was slowly moving between the trees. She liked this kind of weather.
    She made a cup of strong coffee and sat at the small wooden table. On the table
there was an old notebook, a pen, and her favorite red mug. The coffee smelled bitter
but warm, and it helped her think clearly.
    Outside, the city was waking up. Cars appeared one by one, and a bus stopped near
the corner. A dog barked somewhere in the distance, and the silence of the morning was
broken by everyday sounds.
    Sarah opened the notebook and began to write. At first, the words came slowly,
but then the sentences started to flow more easily. She forgot about the time and about
the cold air from the open window.
    When she finally stopped, the sun was already higher in the sky. The fog had
disappeared, and the street was no longer empty. Sarah closed the notebook and smiled.
It had been a good morning.
